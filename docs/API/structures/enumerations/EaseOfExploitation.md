# Enumeration: EaseOfExploitation

Enum representing the ease of exploitation of a finding.

This enum defines the possible levels of ease of exploitation for a finding,
ranging from "Easy" (lowest difficulty) to "Hard" (highest difficulty). The
ease of exploitation indicates how difficult it would be for an attacker to
exploit the identified vulnerability or issue.
